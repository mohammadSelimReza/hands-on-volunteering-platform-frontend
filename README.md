Users can join an event instantly with a "Join Event" button, which adds them to the attendee list.

Any user or organization should be able to post a request for help (e.g., “We need volunteers to distribute winter clothes to homeless people.”)

Other users should be able to offer help and coordinate through comments or private messaging.
Requests should have an urgency level (e.g., low, medium, urgent) to help prioritize volunteer responses.
